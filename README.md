This is a back end application for a social network API where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation

Once you have navigated to your directory, run the command `npm init —y` Then `npm install`in your command line

## Usage

To use this app, navigate to the location of the repo on your computer in your bash terminal. Once you’re inside the repo, run the `node utils/seed.js` to seed the database. If you've created a seeding script in your package.json, just go ahead and run `npm run seed` in your terminal.

Once all the above is done you can run `npm start` and navigate to insomnia to use the app.
